# FileHostPlatform
Small project between myself and other collaborators</br>

### Investigate Stage - </br>
+ Useful site: [Host Tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-upload-files-to-a-server-with-plain-javascript-and-php/)</br>
+ Currently analyzing what the base code does and replicate it with Python (Django)
+ Start on front end

### Design Stage - </br>
+ Decided file host platform will encrypt files using one time pad, then decrypt the file for one time use, before eliminating it from the server
+ Once file is uploaded, front end provides link which will be only point of access. Once link is visited, it will terminate.

### Create Stage - </br>
+ MAMP server has been replaced with Django webserver

### Evaluate Stage -
